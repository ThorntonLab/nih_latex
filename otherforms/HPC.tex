%emphasizes bio cluster.  Text by KRT
\section*{Campus Computing Resources:}  The School of Biological Sciences has established a cluster computing resource housed and supported within the UCI Office of Information Technology (OIT).  This “bio” cluster consists of 22 64-core compute nodes, the majority of which have 512GB of RAM.  Seven of these nodes are freely available to all researchers within the School of Biological Sciences, and the remainder are private nodes belonging to specific labs and/or groups.  The cluster uses Open Grid Engine to manage job submission to nodes, giving priority access to private queues while also allowing those nodes to be used by other researchers in the biological sciences when available.  The GE system also provides access to nodes outside of the School of Biological Sciences when they are not in use, providing up to another 30 64-core nodes. The system is flexible enough that compute nodes purchased for specific projects can be associated with project-specific queues for priority access.

The “bio” cluster currently has 340TB (terabytes) of shared storage connected to the compute nodes via an Infiniband network.  The storage units deploys gluster, a high-performance file system capable of handling the large I/O loads required for modern computing tasks in the biological sciences.
