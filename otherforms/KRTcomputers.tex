\section*{Computers:} The PIâ€™s laboratory has 1 8-core Linux server with 128GB RAM and a 31TB RAID array for storage.  The PI also has 1 64-core, 512GB node on the campus computing cluster (see below) with 11TB of local storage plus two additional 64 cores/512GB nodes with no additional storage.  The main laboratory also has computers available for researchers.  We will add additional nodes and storage to the campus cluster for this project, and upgrade in-lab storage capacity for backup/archival/distribution purposes.
